# Integrator
A fast numerical function integrator using the Monte Carlo method
# Usage
Use the math library wrappers in ``functions.py`` to construct an elementary function in ``main_f``, then run ``main.py``.
Input the bounds of integration when prompted (can be integers or floats) and select a resolution. 10,000-100,000 points will give a decent
approximation, and best results come from 1,000,000 - 50,000,000 points.
